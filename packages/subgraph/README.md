* Step 1. Init the project use abi
```
>> graph init --product subgraph-studio. --abi
✔ Product for which to initialize · hosted-service
✔ Subgraph name · wormhole/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory
✔ Directory to create the subgraph in · DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory
✔ Ethereum network · ropsten
✔ Contract address · 0xCBe0c1ac9eFF75f2002158A1635974caaac3A811
✔ ABI file (path) · ../../contracts/mapping-token/abi/contracts/darwinia/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory.sol/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory.json
✔ Contract Name · DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory
———
  Generate subgraph from ABI
  Write subgraph to directory
✔ Create subgraph scaffold
✔ Initialize subgraph repository
✔ Install dependencies with yarn
✔ Generate ABI and schema types with yarn codegen

Subgraph wormhole/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory created in DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory

Next steps:

  1. Run `graph auth` to authenticate with your deploy key.

  2. Type `cd DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory` to enter the subgraph.

  3. Run `yarn deploy` to deploy the subgraph.

Make sure to visit the documentation on https://thegraph.com/docs/ for further information.
```

* Step 2. Modify schema.graphql to define the entity.

Last step will generate a named ExampleEntity entity in schema.graphql. This maybe not suitable for our project.
So we need to modify schema.graphql and regenerate the schema files.

✔ Load subgraph from subgraph.yaml
  Load contract ABI from abis/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory.json
✔ Load contract ABIs
  Generate types for contract ABI: DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory (abis/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory.json)
  Write types to generated/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory.ts

```

* Step 3. Modify the logic file src/mapping.ts

* Step 4. Create subgraph on subnode
```
>> npx graph create wormhole/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory --node http://127.0.0.1:8020
Created subgraph: wormhole/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory
```

* Step 5. The last step, deploy
```
>> npx graph deploy wormhole/DarwiniaMappingTokenFactory --ipfs http://localhost:5001 --node http://localhost:8020
